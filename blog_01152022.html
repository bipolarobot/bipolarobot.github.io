        <p class="oneColumnP">After the 30+ hours working in Unity (and finishing the Udemy course!), I took a break and decided to dive into Blender due to my curiosity of 3D modeling. The image displayed above is my progress from a YouTube series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHihootMqyGz175gqOPahtw">CrossMind Studio</a>. So far, I’ve completed their "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9qW8ivJ4Q&feature=youtu.be">Blender Day 1 - Absolute Basics - Introduction Series for Beginners</a>" which was a little over an hour long
        </p>

    <div>
            
        <p style="clear:both;" class="oneColumn">

        <b>From just that hour, I learned:</b>
        <ul class="oneColumn">
        <li>Moving around the camera view (at first, this was very difficult to get use to but it gets much easier after practicing the camera movements)</li>
        <li>Hot-keys for basic/complex scaling and moving</li>
        <li>Duplication and aligning</li>
        <li>Global and local axis movement, rotation, and scaling</li>
        <li>Altering and adding vertices</li>
        <li>Simple material application to a low-poly design</li>
    
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p class="oneColumnP">
         I found it helpful to make a reference sheet as a form of practice which made it easier to memorize the hot-keys:
        </p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="oneColumnP">
            
        <img src="images/Blender%20Hot%20Keys.PNG" class="centerImage largeCroppedImage">           
        </div>
    <div>
    <p class="oneColumnP">
         But Blender also has a list of their hot-keys in the form of a PDF: <a href = "https://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderHotkeyReference.pdf">https://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderHotkeyReference.pdf</a> 
        </p>
    <p class="oneColumnP">
         I then followed up with starting some of my own designs. This included hardwood flooring, a TV, and a box truck. I started out small with low-poly type designs and gradually added more detail once I felt more comfortable. I’ve never been good at drawing perceptions in art but I would say Blender is a whole new ball game which made going into this program a lot less daunting. After getting more acquainted with the hot-keys (and having reference photos on hand), it became easier and easier to move around and create 3D models.
